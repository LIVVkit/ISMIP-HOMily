ISMIP-HOMily
============

Recreating the ISMIP-HOM analysis. 


ISMIP-HOM
---------

ISMIP-HOM (ice sheet model intercomparison project for higher-order ice sheet
models) was a set of benchmark experiments officially launched at the 2006 EGU
meeting in Vienna, Austria, 2-7 April 2006. 

[Frank Pattyn][pattyn] and [Tony Payne][payne] convened the experiments, and a
full description of the experiments is maintained on F. Pattyn's website:

The results of the benchmark experiment were published in The Cryosphere:

The numerical results of the experiment were distributed as supplemental

The numerical results can also be found within this repository under the
`ismip_all` directory. 


Recreate
--------

This repository provides the script `recreate.py` which will recreate the
analysis figures from the manuscript linked above, and output the mean, min, and
max lines needed to recreate the figures as a set of text files. This allows for
easy comparisons to new model results.
